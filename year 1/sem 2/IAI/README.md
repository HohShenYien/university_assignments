# A nutrional guide chatbot

This was the chatbot that my group and I have built for the course Introduction to AI.

- Initially, it wasn't required to code out the chatbot, but just using drag and drop platforms,
which as a true programmer, I don't like & it is rather tedious.
- Therefore, two of us were responsible to build the app in Python while the other two
collected the data for this project.

## Technologies
- PyQt
- NLTK
- Tensorflow
